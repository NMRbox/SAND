# Spectral Automatic NMR Deconvolution (SAND)
SAND automatic process and deconvolute 1D NMR spectra into peak tables. Similar workflow works for simulated and expermental datasets. We have tested SAND on urine and worm dataset and will expand it to other new data. It will also be expand to other NMR data types.

# Getting start
SAND works locally, on HPC ([GACRC](https://gacrc.uga.edu)), and on services like [NMRBox](https://nmrbox.org). We provide multiple [tutorials](https://github.com/edisonomics/SAND/tree/main/tutorial) on installation and running.
